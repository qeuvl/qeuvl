# About me
My handle for most sites is qeuvl, but for an actual name, you can *call* me Josiah.  

I would say I'm terrible at coding, which is true. I don't *really know* how to properly use programming languages.   
But hey, I do sort of have a Github Pages site up at [qeuvl.github.io](https://qeuvl.github.io), which technically means I *SORT of* know HTML/CSS.

I also play video games. They're pretty fun&#8482;.

## What am I working on?
As for repositories,

- [qeuvl/qeuvl.github.io](https://github.com/qeuvl/qeuvl.github.io), which is an actual Github Pages site, which can be seen at [qeuvl.github.io](https://qeuvl.github.io)  
- [qeuvl/qeuvl](https://github.com/qeuvl/qeuvl), which is where my README.md is stored. You know, the one you're reading?

## What's up with the profile picture?
[This one?](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88230453)
I don't really know. It's a cool green with shading, and a thin white outline for dark mode users.  
I do really like the colours green and dark grey, so I decided to just make a gradient between those in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/about/).
