# About me
My handle for most sites is qeuvl, but for an actual name, you can *call* me Josiah.  

I would say I'm terrible at coding, which is true. I don't *really know* how to properly use programming languages.   
But I kinda know vanilla HTML/CSS, so there's that.

I also play video games. They're pretty fun&#8482;.

## What am I working on?
Nothing.
